Let's face it, Github is more than a place to drop your source code. With it's newest features, it becomes a social network on it's own where people share ideas, code, documentation, contribute to projects or even find jobs. All of that because of one command: git! Git is most widely used software for source code management and with growth of open source projects, knowladge of git is becoming mandatory. We invite you to our workshop on Git and Github. It's not as hard as you can read on the Internet if you've got friends to share with!

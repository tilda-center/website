Winter is coming!

And it is time to prepare for the long and cold night.

That is why we are inviting you to join us for the second Tilda Fundraising Party.

We are gathering funds for our new projects that will motivate you to get out of the house when snow starts to fall.

Don't whait for the White Walkers to come.

Donate to Tilda.
